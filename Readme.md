# Parser and Interpreter for the simple functional **exp** programming language

This is an experimental work.
On the University in a course about software paradigms we used the theoretical **exp** programming language
to discuss the functional paradigm. There we only worked with it on paper.
Now I wanted to implement it in typescript.
